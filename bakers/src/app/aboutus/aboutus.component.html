        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Bakerz Bite, a family-owned bakery in the heart of the city. We specialize in creating the most delicious baked goods using only the freshest ingredients. </p>
        <p>Our story began in 2005 when our founder, Mary, started baking cupcakes in her home kitchen. She quickly gained a reputation for her delicious treats and decided to open up a small bakery. Over the years, we have expanded our menu to include cakes, cookies, bread, and other baked goods.</p>
        <p>At Bakerz Bite, we believe that baking is an art form. That's why we take the time to create each item with care and attention to detail. We use only the best ingredients, including locally sourced organic flour, fresh fruit, and high-quality chocolate. We believe that the quality of our ingredients is what sets us apart from other bakeries.</p>
        <p>We are proud to be a part of the local community and love serving our customers. Thank you for choosing Bakerz Bite for your sweet treats.</p>
